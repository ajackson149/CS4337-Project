## CS4347 Database Project

Just a project for school

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two important folders:

- `src`: the folder for Main.java and input files
- `output`: the folder for output files

HOW TO RUN:
run init_db.py to initialize the database, this will create the library.db file.
run gui.py, this will show the UI interface where you can check out books and check in books


As a librarian the librarian password is adminpassword


Extra credit:
Needs a login in order to access library functions.
Functionality for multiple users to log in, even having a librarian with admin permissions.
Homepage for borrowers that lets them log in, and query the status of the checkouts
Displaying multiple results, multiple books can be checked out via control + click or shift + click
